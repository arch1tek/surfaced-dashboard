## Example Interactions

### Query: "Show me party hubs in Bengaluru"

**Gemini Response**:
```json
{
  "locations": [
    {
      "name": "Koramangala",
      "coordinates": { "latitude": 12.9279, "longitude": 77.6271 },
      "description": "Trendy nightlife area with pubs and bars",
      "category": "nightlife"
    },
    {
      "name": "Indiranagar",
      "coordinates": { "latitude": 12.9716, "longitude": 77.6412 },
      "description": "Popular entertainment district",
      "category": "nightlife"
    }
  ],
  "query_type": "party_hubs",
  "search_terms": ["pubs", "bars", "nightclubs"]
}
```

**Result**: 6-12 top-rated pubs and bars displayed across both areas with markers on map.

### Query: "Best restaurants in HSR Layout"

- 6 top-rated restaurants in HSR Layout
- Markers clustered around HSR Layout area
- Restaurant details with ratings, cuisine type, price level
- Map focused on HSR Layout with appropriate zoom

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Services not initialized"
- **Cause**: API keys not properly set
- **Solution**: Re-enter API keys in settings

#### "Google Maps not loaded"
- **Cause**: Google Maps API key invalid or missing permissions
- **Solution**: Check API key and enable required APIs

#### "No venues found"
- **Cause**: Query too specific or API quota exceeded
- **Solution**: Try broader queries or check API quotas

#### Empty Gemini response
- **Cause**: Gemini API key invalid or query not understood
- **Solution**: Check API key and rephrase query

### Performance Tips

1. **API Quota Management**:
   - Gemini: 60 requests per minute (free tier)
   - Places: 1000 requests per day (free tier)

2. **Query Optimization**:
   - Use specific area names for better results
   - Include venue type keywords
   - Avoid overly complex queries

3. **Caching**:
   - Results are not cached currently
   - Each query triggers new API calls
   - Consider implementing caching for production

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Query History**: Save and replay previous searches
- **Favorites**: Save favorite venues
- **Directions**: Integrate with Google Maps directions
- **Reviews**: Show recent reviews from Google
- **Photos**: Display venue photos from Google Places
- **Filters**: Filter by price, rating, open status
- **Recommendations**: AI-powered venue recommendations

### Technical Improvements
- **Result Caching**: Cache Gemini and Places responses
- **Offline Support**: Store popular venues for offline access
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and pagination for large result sets
- **Analytics**: Track query patterns and popular areas

## Security Notes

1. **API Key Storage**: Keys are stored in browser localStorage only
2. **No Server Storage**: Keys are never sent to application servers
3. **Domain Restrictions**: Recommend restricting Google API keys to your domain
4. **Rate Limiting**: Both APIs have rate limits - implement appropriate handling

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify API keys are valid and have required permissions
3. Test with simple queries first
4. Check API quotas in respective consoles
